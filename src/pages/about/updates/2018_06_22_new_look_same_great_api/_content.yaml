- "The openFDA project was created to provide easy access to public data, to create a new level of openness and accountability, to ensure the privacy and security of public FDA data, and ultimately to educate the public and save lives. The concept was to index high-value, high priority and scalable public-access data, format and document that data in developer and consumer-friendly standards, and make that data available via a public-access portal that enables developers to quickly and easily use it in applications."
- "As part of our continued efforts to achieve the goals of this project, we're constantly looking for ways to improve the openFDA experience as well as provide access to new datasets. Today we're very proud to unveil the latest in this series up improvements: a brand new look and feel for the openFDA website."
- "With this new suite of enhancements the openFDA website is easier than ever to use. We've simplified language, completely redesigned the site layout, and provided even more ways to learn about and interact with openFDA datasets."
- "We hope you find the new website as delightful to use as it was to develop, and encourage you to let us know if you have any questions or comments about the new layout - you can find our contact information in the main nav bar under Community."
