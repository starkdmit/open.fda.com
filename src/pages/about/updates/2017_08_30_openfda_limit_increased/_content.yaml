- "Since its launch in June 2014, the impetus for openFDA has been to make it easier for an application, mobile device, web developer, or researcher to access publicly available data from FDA using APIs."
- "To promote equitable access and to manage the load on the system, openFDA has limited search results for any API query to 5,000 records."
- "We are pleased to announce that this search result limit has been increased now to 25,000. There is no change in the syntax for queries (including the use of the limit parameter), just an increase to the potential amount of data returned."
