openFDA is an exciting new initiative in the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Informatics and Technology Innovation spearheaded by FDA’s Chief Informatics Officer. openFDA will offer easy access to FDA public data and highlight projects using these data in both the public and private sector to further regulatory or scientific missions, educate the public, and save lives.

## What will it do?

On launch, openFDA will provide API and raw download access to a number of high-value structured datasets. Additionally, openFDA will provide a platform for public challenges issued by the FDA and a place for the community to interact with each other and FDA domain experts with the goal of spurring innovation around FDA data. We're currently focused on working on datasets in the following areas:

- Adverse Events: FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System, a database that contains millions of adverse event and medication error reports submitted to FDA covering all regulated drugs.
- Recalls: Enforcement Report and Product Recalls Data, containing information gathered from public notices about certain recalls of FDA-regulated products
- Documentation: Structured Product Labeling Data, containing detailed product label information on many FDA-regulated products

Beta access to the datasets via APIs or download capabilities is anticipated for Summer 2014, with a larger public release in Fall of this year.

## How can I join in?

We're still hard at work curating and refining the data we intend to launch, so please stay tuned for the latest updates and information on openFDA.
