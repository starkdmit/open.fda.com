On May 22, 2015, Dr. Taha Kass-Hout gave an update on the openFDA project at the Big Data in Biomedicine conference at Stanford University.

His talk, coming a year after the first APIs were launched at openFDA, covers the progress that has been made with the project so far. Based on the three pillars of Open Data, Open Source, and Open Community, the openFDA project has spawned dozens of apps, thousands of community members, and millions of API calls.
