- "## About food recalls and enforcement reports"
- "Recalls are an appropriate alternative method for removing or correcting marketed consumer products, their labeling, and/or promotional literature that violate the laws administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recalls afford equal consumer protection but generally are more efficient and timely than formal administrative or civil actions, especially when the product has been widely distributed."
- "Manufacturers and/or distributors may initiate a recall at any time to fulfill their responsibility to protect the public health from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception, or are otherwise defective. Firms may also initiate a recall following notification of a problem by FDA or a state agency, in response to a formal request by FDA, or as ordered by FDA."
- "## Enforcement reports"
- "An enforcement report contains information on actions taken in connection with FDA regulatory activities. The data served by this API endpoint includes enforcement reports about device product recalls."
- "This API should not be used as a method to collect data to issue alerts to the public. FDA seeks publicity about a recall only when it believes the public needs to be alerted to a serious hazard. FDA works with industry and our state partners to publish press releases and other public notices about recalls that may potentially present a significant or serious risk to the consumer or user of the product. Subscribe to this Recall/Safety Alert feed here."
- "Whereas not all recalls are announced in the media or on our recall press release page all FDA-monitored recalls go into FDAâ€™s Enforcement Report once they are classified according to the level of hazard involved.  For more information, see FDA 101: Product Recalls from First Alert to Effectiveness Checks."
