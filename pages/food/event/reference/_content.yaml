- "## About"
- "The openFDA food and cosmetic adverse event API returns data from the [Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](/data/caers/), a database that contains information on food and cosmetic product adverse events submitted to FDA."
- "An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report adverse health effects and product complaints about food and cosmetic products. These may include side effects, product use errors, and product quality problems. Reporting is voluntary for beverages, conventional foods, and cosmetics, which means that manufacturers and citizens may report them at any time but are not obligated to. For dietary supplements, manufacturers, packers, and distributers must notify the FDA if they receive reports about serious adverse events in connection with the use of their products."
- "Reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and consumers is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event reports directly from healthcare professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report adverse events to the productsâ€™ manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is normally required to send the report to FDA."
- disclaimer:
  - "CAERS data does have limitations. Even with mandatory reporting of serious adverse events for dietary supplements, generally only a small fraction of adverse events associated with any product is reported. A report may list several products, as well as several reactions that the consumer experienced. No individual food or cosmetic product is connected to any individual reaction. When a report lists multiple products and multiple reactions, there is no way to conclude from the data therein that a given product is responsible for a given reaction."
  - "Reports to FDA do not necessarily include all relevant data, such as whether an individual also suffered from other medical conditions (such as cardiac disease) or took other supplements or medication at the same time. They also may not include accurate or complete contact information for FDA to seek further information about the event, or complainants may choose not to participate in the follow-up investigation."
  - "When important information is missing from a report, it is difficult for FDA to fully evaluate whether the product caused the adverse event or simply coincided with it. The fact that an adverse event happened after a person took a dietary supplement does not necessarily mean that the dietary supplement caused the adverse event."
- "### Responsible use of the data"
- "Adverse event reports submitted to FDA do not undergo extensive validation or verification. Therefore, **a causal relationship cannot be established between product and reactions listed in a report.** While a suspected relationship *may* exist, it is not medically validated and should not be the sole source of information for clinical decision making or other assumptions about the safety or efficacy of a product."
- "Additionally, it is important to remember that adverse event reports represent a small percentage of total usage numbers of a product. Common products may have a higher number of adverse events due to the higher total number of people using the product. In recent years the FDA has undertaken efforts to increase collection of adverse events. Increases in the total number of adverse events is likely caused by improved reporting."
- "### How adverse events are organized"
- "Each report received regarding an individual that experiences an adverse event is assigned a unique report number."

- "## Anatomy of a response"
- "This is a simulated openFDA API return for a non-`count` query. It is divided into two high-level sections, `meta` and `results`."
- example: anatomy
- "### Meta"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `meta` section includes a disclaimer, a link to the openFDA data license, and information about the results that follow."
- example: meta
- fields:
  - disclaimer
  - meta.license
  - meta.last_updated
  - meta.results.skip
  - meta.results.limit
  - meta.results.total
- "### Results"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching adverse event reports returned by the API."
- "Each adverse event report consists of these major sections:"
- ul:
  - "Header: General information about the adverse event report"
  - "Consumer: Information about the individual who experienced the adverse event"
  - "Products: Information about the products involved in the adverse event report"
  - "Reactions: Information on the reactions or symptoms experienced by the individual involved"
  - "Outcomes: Information on known outcomes or consequences of the adverse event"
- example: results
- "## Field-by-field reference"
- "### Header"
