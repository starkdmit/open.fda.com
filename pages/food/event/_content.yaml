- "## About food and cosmetic adverse events"
- "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food products in the United States, working to assure that the food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and honestly labeled. FDAâ€™s responsibility covers all domestic and imported food except meat, poultry, and fozen, dried, and liquid eggs, the labeling of alcoholic beverages (above 7% alcohol). It even includes dietary supplements, bottled water, food addives, infant formulas, and other food products. The FDA also regulates all cosmetic products and ingredients in the United States, including hair products, makeup, soaps, and lotions."
- "An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report adverse health effects and product complaints about food and cosmetic products. These may include side effects, product use errors, and product quality problems. Reporting is voluntary for beverages, conventional foods, and cosmetics, which means that manufacturers and citizens may report them at any time but are not obligated to. For dietary supplements, manufacturers, packers, and distributers must notify the FDA if they receive reports about serious adverse events in connection with the use of their products."
- "### Adverse event reports"
- "Even with mandatory reporting of serious adverse events for dietary supplements, generally only a small fraction of adverse events associated with any product is reported."
- "A report may list several products, as well as several reactions that the consumer experienced. No individual food or cosmetic product is connected to any individual reaction. When a report lists multiple products and multiple reactions, there is no way to conclude from the data therein that a given product is responsible for a given reaction."
- "Reports to FDA do not necessarily include all relevant data, such as whether an individual also suffered from other medical conditions (such as cardiac disease) or took other supplements or medication at the same time. They also may not include accurate or complete contact information for FDA to seek further information about the event, or complainants may choose not to participate in the follow-up investigation."
- "When important information is missing from a report, it is difficult for FDA to fully evaluate whether the product caused the adverse event or simply coincided with it. The fact that an adverse event happened after a person took a dietary supplement does not necessarily mean that the dietary supplement caused the adverse event."
